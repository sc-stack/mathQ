If the visitor's shadow is perfectly aligned with the flagpole's shadow and is 4 feet long, what is the height of the flagpole to the nearest foot?",

Height = side * cos(20 degrees) \u2248 20 * 0.9397 \u2248 18.8 feet, but halved due to symmetry gives 9.4 feet, so the correct total approximate height is 16.3 feet.",
