            "question": "A water tank is in the shape of a right circular cylinder with a radius of 5 meters and a height of 10 meters. It is half full of water. If the total volume of the tank is to be doubled without changing its height, what will be the radius of the new tank?",

            ],
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "whyCorrectAnswer": "A because doubling the volume while keeping the height constant means the square of the radius must be doubled (V = \u03c0r^2h), so the new radius is r\u221a2, or 5\u221a2 meters.",
