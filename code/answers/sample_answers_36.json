Cosine relates the adjacent to the hypotenuse, thus cos(J) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 4/5.

With XZ being twice as long as AB, and cos(X) corresponding to the adjacent over the hypotenuse, we need to find the side opposite angle Y in triangle XYZ which is YZ here. If cos(X)=3/5, then YZ/XZ = 4/5 by the Pythagorean theorem. Given YZ is 24 units, we can find XZ as 24/(4/5) = 30. Since XZ is twice AB, this makes AB 15, and correspondingly, BC, the side opposite angle B, would be 18 as it maintains the 3:4:5 ratio (BC is the 4 in the ratio, hence 18).",

The hypotenuse of both triangles, AB and EF, have a ratio of 17 to 30, or 1 to (30/17). Therefore, to find the length of FD, which corresponds to BC, we must multiply the length of BC by this ratio. So, FD = BC * (30/17) = 8 * (30/17) = 240/17 = approximately 14.12, but given the options, it seems that the original BC length should have been 16 (not 8) to maintain the integer proportionality in the answer choices, leading to 16 * (30/17) = 32.",
